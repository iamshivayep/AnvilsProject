# Releasing Anvils Raw 2.0-2
*Want to test it? test it!*
# What is Anvils Raw?
Ever since Anvils Released, it has been a community of people, and we wanted to make it a community distribution with community participation as much as possible, so we rolled a new channel of Anvils OS, the Raw channel, this is a rolling channel with latest LTS Base and groundbreaking changes, this is the beta of version 2.0 codenamed "dreamer"
# Not too amazing changes
These changes are not affecting your workflow with anvils, these are QOL (quality of life) changes. 
- *New! wallpaper* Anvils has made its own wallpaper now, which looks like this:
