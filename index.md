# News!
This is to inform all the users of The AnvilsOS that we are switching bases again, although, we are confident on our new base, FEDORA! i know it is irritating for the FOSS torrent guys and the people using Anvils. but it is what it is, ubuntu was just not a comfortable base and as it is the starting days of Anvils i thought to change it


## Welcome to Anvils
Anvils is a fast, powerful operating system based on fedora, which makes Desktop Linux friendly 



## Anvils is completely a hobby distribution, and if you are using Anvils, there is no gurantee of the software you are using and if you encounter any problems, feel free to fix them yourself.
