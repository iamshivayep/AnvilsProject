# Update 22-8-22
As of 22nd August 2022, the official Anvils-1-22822 iso has been compiled and released. [Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h4dGFStdDPw9bK0LDTdHA3NvN1DuuuI4/view?usp=sharing). Thanks to everyone for making this day memorable!

## Welcome to Anvils
Anvils is a fast, powerful operating system based on Ubuntu, which makes Desktop Linux friendly 

## Why Anvils and not Ubuntu?
Anvils is bug-for-bug compaitible with Ubuntu Linux, but ubuntu has a major issue of slowness and snap packages, which are a headache to remove, Anvils does that fixes for you and it also has some optimizations made to it.

# Installation Guide
You can take a look at the [Anvils Wiki](https://iamshivayep.github.io/Anvils-Wiki/) for installation instructions

# Contributions
Anvils is created using the Custom Ubuntu Image Creator tool (CUBIC), so unfortunately, there is no way to contribute to anvils except suggestions, but if you have the effort and storage to host the iso so we can check out your modified iso, feel free to host it, you just have to edit anvilsOS latest .iso file in cubic to make your very own Anvils, eventually i will figure out a way to contribute

## Anvils is completely a hobby distribution, and if you are using Anvils, there is no gurantee of the software you are using and if you encounter any problems, feel free to fix them yourself.
