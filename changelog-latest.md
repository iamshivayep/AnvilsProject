# Releasing Anvils 2.0.2
this time we got a point release! after a suspension break we are back, anvils **2.0.2** isn't a major release, but fixes some major issues.
# Flatpak inclusion
Flatpak and Flathub repos are included out of the box now, so you don't have to use the toolkit to install them (PS. It was broken and wouldn't add the flathub repo!).
# It got purged!
finally, anvils decided to give up on snaps, it has gone out of the anvils books.
# New browser
your new browser on anvils is the brave browser, opensource chromium engine based browser which helps to disable trakcers and cookies! (not sponsered)
# That's it
not a major release really, but it improved some major mistakes, see you next time, with 2.0.3!
