# Releasing Anvils 1.5 LTS (wildride)
>*the ride is wild, and anvils wildride is here*

# Major Changes
Anvils has now dropped support for its GNOME edition and 1.0 edition for good, and has switched to the XFCE desktop environment now, The major changes are not only at the desktop environment, but also, at the core.
>*Note: Anvils has stopped using the LTS kernel of ubuntu and is now using the linux-xanmod-edge kernel, if a newer kernel is available, just do sudo nala upgrade in the terminal*
>
The new xanmod kernel being used by anvils has much better hardware support and more stability, the xanmod kernel is known to be very smooth for computing AND gaming. combined with the already made optimizations of anvils, you are down for the amazing experience.

# Bug Fixes
- Fixed The issue of anvils not booting for some hardware (kvm machines for example)
- Fixed high ram usage
- Fixed theming and wallpapers

# UI Changes
Anvils has replaced the long lived dracula theme in favour of nord, we think this theme is light on the eyes and makes you work efficiently!

# Applications
Anvils now includes *Lutris, Wine, Winetricks and other gaming apps* for your gaming experience!

# Something not that important
the SNTI note of anvils releases is something not that important and this time, there is no anvils logo you will find in the whole system, sure there is the neofetch and os-release files modified, but a proper logo for anvils is not decided yet, *Maybe Contribute? :D*

# Thats it!
We thank the developers and the Anvils Team for this release, 1.5 wasn't meant to be a major release, rather a point release, but the bugs of anvils made it a major release! thank you
